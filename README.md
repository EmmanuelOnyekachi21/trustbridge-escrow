## Overview

TrustBridge enables trusted transactions between buyers and vendors by holding funds in the original currency (source-settled: NGN, GHS, KES, etc.) during escrow, avoiding exchange rate risk. Funds are released only after service confirmation, with an automatic 15% platform fee deducted (net of processor fees). A 14-day inactivity timer moves inactive transactions to a "dispute vault" for admin resolution.

Built as a **production-grade backend** with real-user intent in mind: concurrency-safe ledger, idempotent operations, audit trails, and compliance awareness (KYC, AML, licensing considerations).

**Current Status**: Phase 1 (Foundation & Project Setup) — Early development / MVP phase. Not yet production-deployed. **Strong compliance & legal warnings** apply (see below).

## Core Features

- **Source-Settled Escrow** — Funds held in original currency (no premature FX conversion)
- **15% Platform Fee** — Deducted only on successful release (net of Flutterwave fees)
- **14-Day Dispute Vault** — Auto-freeze on inactivity; admin-mediated resolution
- **Multi-Currency Support** — NGN, GHS, KES + real-time USD-view conversion (on-the-fly, cached rates)
- **Payment Methods** — Cards, bank transfers (via Flutterwave Standard/Direct Charge)
- **Authentication** — Firebase Auth (email/password, Google, Apple Sign In)
- **Payouts** — Vendor withdrawals via Flutterwave Transfer API (NUBAN, M-Pesa, etc.)
- **Webhooks** — Secure handling of Flutterwave events (charge.completed, transfers)
- **Ledger Integrity** — PostgreSQL with ACID transactions, DECIMAL for money

### Key Components

- **API Layer**: FastAPI with async endpoints, Pydantic validation, JWT middleware
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with async SQLAlchemy, DECIMAL precision for money
- **Auth Layer**: Firebase Admin SDK for token verification and user management
- **Background Jobs**: Celery workers for webhooks, timers, and async operations
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for exchange rates, session data, and Celery broker
- **Payment Gateway**: Flutterwave for collections (hosted checkout) and payouts (Transfer API)

### Transaction Flow

1. **Vendor creates invoice** → Flutterwave payment link generated
2. **Customer pays** → Webhook marks funds as held in escrow (platform balance)
3. **Service confirmation** → Release endpoint deducts 15% fee → transfers 85% net to vendor
4. **Inactivity (14 days)** → Auto-dispute status; admin resolves (refund/transfer)

### Data Models (Core)

- **Users**: Firebase UID, email, role (buyer/vendor/admin), KYC status
- **Transactions**: Escrow state machine, amounts, currency, timestamps
- **Wallets**: User balances per currency
- **AuditLogs**: Immutable event trail for compliance
- **DisputeVault**: Frozen transactions awaiting resolution

## Important Warnings & Compliance Notes ⚠️

**This is a fintech project handling real money — treat with extreme caution.**

### Regulatory Compliance

#### Nigeria (CBN Regulations)
- **PSP/MMO License Required**: Holding funds and charging fees may require a Payment Service Provider or Mobile Money Operator license
- **Capital Requirements**: Often ₦100M–₦2B+ capital/escrow deposit
- **Historical Context**: Many escrow platforms have faced shutdowns without proper authorization
- **Action Required**: Consult CBN guidelines and fintech lawyers before live deployment

#### Multi-Country Considerations
- **Ghana**: Bank of Ghana (BoG) payment system licensing
- **Kenya**: Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) payment service provider authorization
- **General**: Each market has unique regulatory requirements

### Technical Compliance

#### KYC (Know Your Customer)
- Vendors **must** complete KYC before payouts
- Flutterwave enforces transaction limits based on KYC tier
- Implement KYC status checks in payout flow
- Store KYC verification timestamps and documents

#### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry)
- **Use hosted checkout** (Flutterwave Standard/Inline) to avoid direct card handling
- Maintains SAQ-A compliance scope (minimal requirements)
- Never store card numbers, CVV, or full PAN
- Log payment references only, not sensitive data

#### AML (Anti-Money Laundering)
- Implement transaction monitoring and pattern detection
- Set transaction limits and velocity checks
- Maintain audit trails for all financial operations
- Report suspicious activity per local regulations
- Document dispute resolution policies

### Financial Architecture Limitations

#### Flutterwave Escrow Constraints
- **No native long-hold escrow**: Funds held in main merchant/payout balance
- **State tracking in database**: Application-level escrow management
- **Settlement timing**: Understand Flutterwave settlement cycles
- **Balance management**: Monitor platform balance to ensure payout capacity

#### Risk Mitigation
- Implement reserve fund for operational liquidity
- Monitor balance vs. outstanding escrow obligations
- Set up alerts for low balance conditions
- Consider multi-provider strategy for redundancy

### Legal Disclaimers

⚠️ **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE YET**

This repository is for:
- Learning and educational purposes
- Prototyping and proof-of-concept
- Development towards eventual compliant launch

**Before any live deployment or real-money testing:**
1. Consult a fintech lawyer in your target markets
2. Obtain necessary licenses and regulatory approvals
3. Complete security audit and penetration testing
4. Implement comprehensive insurance coverage
5. Establish legal entity with proper capitalization
6. Draft terms of service and privacy policy
7. Set up customer support and dispute resolution processes

**The authors are not liable for any financial, legal, or operational consequences arising from use of this software.**

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Flat app/ structure**: Keeps imports simple (`from app.models import User`)
2. **API versioning**: `/api/v1/` allows future breaking changes without disrupting clients
3. **Service layer**: Business logic separated from API routes for testability
4. **Pydantic schemas**: Separate from SQLAlchemy models for clean API contracts
5. **Core utilities**: Shared code in `core/` to avoid circular imports
6. **Task isolation**: Celery tasks in dedicated `tasks/` package
7. **Comprehensive testing**: Unit, integration, and fixture separation

## API Documentation

### Available Endpoints (Phase 1)

#### Health Check
```http
GET /health
```

Returns system health status including database and Redis connectivity.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-26T12:00:00Z",
  "database": "connected",
  "redis": "connected",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

### Upcoming Endpoints (Future Phases)

See the [Development Roadmap](#-development-roadmap) for planned API endpoints in each phase.

Interactive API documentation available at:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=backend --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_currency.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run integration tests only
pytest tests/integration/
```

### Test Coverage Goals

- Unit tests: >80% coverage
- Integration tests: All critical paths
- Contract tests: Flutterwave API mocks

---

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build production image
docker build -t trustbridge-backend:latest -f backend/Dockerfile .

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Cloud Platforms

#### Railway
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

#### Render
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Create new Web Service
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy automatically on push

#### AWS (ECS/Fargate)
- Use provided Dockerfile
- Configure RDS for PostgreSQL
- Configure ElastiCache for Redis
- Set up Application Load Balancer
- Configure CloudWatch for logging

   flake8 backend/

   # Type checking
   mypy backend/
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
   ```

   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` New feature
   - `fix:` Bug fix
   - `docs:` Documentation changes
   - `test:` Test additions or changes
   - `refactor:` Code refactoring
   - `chore:` Maintenance tasks

6. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**
